## Test Requirements
You need to create a login page and a client page
The login page should have a login form using the request service provided with the function login (username, password)
The login will return a token to use on the get states/cities request as getJson(token)

The client page must be a table with all the client attributes
 - first name
 - last name
 - city
 - state
 - id
 - companies

The companies object must be created by the user and should contain this attributes:
 - company name
 - id
 
Each client can have multiple companies 
The client add form should have validation, every field is required, it must have at least 1 company and you cant select city until the state is selected

Everything must be responsive
Each page for the crud must be on a separate url/page

url/client
url/client/add
